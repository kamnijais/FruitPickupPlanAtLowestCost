     * Pelle and Kajsa drive from Gothenburg to Helsingborg. Along the way
     they pass several fruit stands.
     Each fruit stand sells baskets of cherries at a price, and baskets with
     peaches at a different price.
     Pelle wants to buy a basket of cherries, and Kajsa wants to buy a
     basket of peaches. They want to stop at only one fruit stand.
     What fruit stand should they stop at to minimize the total cost?
     The program will print the number of the first fruit stand that has the
     lowest possible total price for a basket of cherries and a basket of
     peaches (you yourself put the price of the fruits in the stands).
